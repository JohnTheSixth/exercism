This repository contains my solutions to the exercises available from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/).

The `master` branch will contain my latest iterations from each exercise. I'll most likely use different branches for my tentative solutions, or for sampling different tracks I might not want to commit to.

Right now I'm focusing on Ruby and JavaScript. I'll stay with those and figure out what comes next.

You can find me on exercism.io [here](http://exercism.io/JohnTheSixth).
